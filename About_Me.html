        <h1> Hello, Welcome to Shivani's world!</h1>
        <p>
          I am a UX/UI designer  based on California,USA. 
          I have a passion for interacting with users, 
          helping to design simple, attractive yet intuitive 
          user- interacted products with excellent collaboration skills 
          with other people.

          Shivaniâ€™s Story:-

        </h2>

        <p>
          I was creative thinker since I was a child. 
          I did many art projects and drawings in my leisure time.
          When I decided my field, I was more attracted towards computer 
          science-coding skills. I learned coding but wanted to expand coding
          in the creative style. Then I started surfing different fields where 
          coding is used and I came across UX/UI field. After I knew about it,
          I enrolled in the UCI to study about it. And now, I am passionate about
          it and am ready to help users for their pleasant experience throughout
          the process. With my skills, I can create better user experience and 
          also communicate easily with the developers in their language and help
          troubleshoot the problems.
